The goal of the first exercise session is to create your first webpage and get used to the VS code editor. In this session, you will create a CV HTML website for yourself (or for a fictional character). The website must fulfill the following requirements

It must contain 4 separate pages: a main page (index.html), and 3 other pages: cv.html, hobbies.html, and contact.html
All four pages must use the same stylesheet (style.css), which must contain at least 10 rules to change the style of the HTML elements (for example font color, background color, etc.)
All four pages must have a menu to navigate between the four different pages. 

The main page (index.html) must contain the following:
  - Full name
  - Picture
  - Contact information (email and socials)
  - Brief description of the person

The cv.html page must contain a resumé of your achievements:

Include a bullet list of your education and another one of your work experience

When listing the companies you have worked for or educational institutions that you have attended, their name should link to their website and open in a new page

Include a table of your language skills including writing, speaking, reading, listening and overall level (A1-C2) for each language that you know

Include any other sections that you deem appropriate (e.g., technical skills)

The hobbies.html page must contain:
- A list of your hobbies 
- A Youtube video of a snippet of your favorite TV show
- A Spotify player of your favorite song. See https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/embeds/tutorials/creating-an-embed for instructions

The contact.html page must contain a form to reach you (it does not need to work). The fields of the form should be:
- Name
- Age (numerical field)
- Email
- Message
- A multiple choice question “How did you know about my page?”
  - Google
  - From a friend
  - From Linkedin
  - Other
